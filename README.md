## Features

You can copy and paste the following tree elements via the system clipboard:

- Parts and chapters,
- sections,
- stages, 
- plot lines,
- plot points,
- characters, 
- locations, 
- items, 
- project notes.

Elements can be transferred to and from the clipboard one by one. 
The element's properties and children are copied, except relationships. 

Via the clipboard, you can transfer these elements between different *novelibre*
projects, or within a project. 

## Requirements
